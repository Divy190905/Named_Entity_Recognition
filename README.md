Named Entity Recognition (NER) using BERT

Introduction

This project implements Named Entity Recognition (NER) using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). NER is a subtask of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that identifies entities such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more in text data.

Features

✅ Uses a pre-trained BERT model for token classification.

✅ Fine-tunes BERT on a labeled dataset for entity recognition.

✅ Supports entity types such as:

Person (PER)

Organization (ORG)

Location (LOC)

Miscellaneous (MISC)

✅ Implements tokenization using the BERT tokenizer.

✅ Uses PyTorch and Hugging Face's transformers library.
